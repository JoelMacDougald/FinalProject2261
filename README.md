# README #

This README will explain how to download and deploy my final project

### Download ###

The project has been submitted on SAM as well as here.
This repository can be cloned and downloaded locally.

### Deployment ###

This project is a PHP coded project, with an accompanying database.

This project works best when run on PHP Storm.

Ensure you have Xampp (or equivalent) running Apache/MySql.

The database script is located in at FinalProject/FinalProjectDbFile/FinalProjectDbFile.sql.
It is easiest to copy the script from the file, open PHPmyAdmin, and run the code in the relevant section. See the instructional video for reference.

Once the database has been created, the project can be run by several methods. The easiest is to find the page FinalProject/IndexMain/mainPage.php and click on the browser of choice in
the top right hand corner. All development was done on Google Chrome.

Once the webpage is uploaded, the website can be used.
